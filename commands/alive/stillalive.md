This was a triumph!

I'm making a note here: Huge success!

It's hard to overstate my satisfaction

Aperture Science: We do what we must because we can

For the good of all of us...except the ones who are dead

But there's no sense crying over every mistake

You just keep on trying till you run out of cake

And the Science gets done, and you make a neat gun

For the people who are still alive

I'm not even angry

I'm being So. Sincere. Right now.

Even though you broke my heart and killed me...

And tore me to pieces.

And threw every piece into a fire.

As they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you!

Now these points of data make a beautiful line

And we're out of beta, we're releasing on time

So I'm GLaD I got burned

Think of all the things we learned

For the people who are still alive...

Go ahead and leave me...

I think I prefer to stay inside

Maybe you'll find someone else to help you

Maybe Black Mesa

THAT WAS A JOKE! HAHA! FAT CHANCE!

Anyway, this cake is great, it's so delicious and moist

Look at me still talking when there's Science to do

When I look out there, it makes me GLaD I'm not you

I've experiments to run

There is research to be done

On the people who are still alive...

Believe me I am still alive

I'm doing science and I'm still alive

I feel FANTASTIC and I'm still alive

While you're dying I'll be still alive

And when you're dead I will be still alive

still alive...

STILL ALIVE
